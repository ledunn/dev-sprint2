Three example apps of simliar size/complexity:

1. A password protected site to host a photo/image collection with ability to navigate in between images (like a slideshow).
2. A really basic translation/vocab quiz (for learning a new language):
	-has different links to different difficulty levels or topic themes (e.g. colors, animals, foods)
	-selects a word at random from database, prompts the user for word meaning 
	-gives the user a "correct" or "incorrect" response
3. A site with ability for users to leave a comment on a song or image hosted by the site.
